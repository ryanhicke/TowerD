This si the engine for a Tower Defense game that I wrote back in 2008. I found this on an old harddrive and pushed it to Git so that I wouldn't lose it.

This is written in ActionScript 3.0 and compiles to a flash game. This used to be hosted on the website MartyTheDog.com which is now defunct.

The files in the src/com/* dirs are written by other people (I think the licenses work) but the core of the game is contained in the Hicke.Ryan.* packages was all written by me when learning how to code
